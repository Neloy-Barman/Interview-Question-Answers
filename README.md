<h2>What is Embeddings?</h2>
<strong>
  We need to convert the words or tokens into numerical representations so that the computational models can understand and work with. This convertion is performed by embedding layers.</br>
  Let's take a simple example. If our tokens are words, then the embedding layers tries to find the similarity  between the words such as cats and dogs by putting the vectors close together in the vector space. This closeness stems from the fact that they often appear in the similar context. As we stack multiple layers in the model, the layers may find out more and more complex concepts. Like the first layer may find out that cats and dogs are similar types of animals. The second layer might find that what roles these animals play in a sentence such as being pets or cute animals.
